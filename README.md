# Contacts-API
A contacts api built using django rest framework

# Features 
- Authentication: I implemented token-based authentication to fortify the API against unauthorized access. Utilizing DRF's authentication classes, i ensure secure communication between clients and the API
- CRUD Operations: Leveraging the power of Django Rest Framework to seamlessly perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on contacts.
- Paginated Response: I leveraged the robust capabilities of Django Rest Framework's Pagination class to seamlessly deliver paginated responses for all endpoints returning multiple objects. By implementing pagination, users can efficiently retrieve a specified number of data per response, thereby minimizing query time and significantly boosting overall performance
